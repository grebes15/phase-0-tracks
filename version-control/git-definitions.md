# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows us to view the history of revisions to one or more files and merge revisions made by different people. This is useful because it allows different people to collaborate together on projects and view all the changes that have been made to a project.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch represents an independent line of development. It is a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history without starting a new repository. One would use a branch to be able to commit changes without having other people looking at the changes that have been made. It is also useful to use if one were to be doing testing on a certain piece of source code without others having conflictions that the master branch of the repository.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit records changes to the working repository. A good commit message serve a few purposes. One of the purposes will allow a speed up in the reviewing process. Antoher purpose is to help us write a good release note. The last purpose is help future maintainers so when programmers look at it after a period of time, programmers will still be able to see why a particuar change was made to the code of why a specific feature was added.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when you have commits in your current branch which are not in the other branch or when you have commits in the other branch which are not in the current branch.
