Release 0: Equip Your New Robot
Elevator Algorithm
-Initialize an elevator object

-Register a request for any given floor

-If on ground floor, the only position to go is up

-If not on ground floor, then requests can either go up or down

-Once elevator is on the requested floor, press the floor that is going to be visited

-Travel to all of the floors being requested

-Travel to the given floor to drop off passengers or pick up passengers

-Start another elevator route according to the current requests being asked

-Travel to the request floor until all requests have been fulfilled. 

Release 1: Find a Real-Life Algorithm

One common task in my life that could be translated into an algorithm would be makeing scrambled eggs in the morning. Here are the steps:
Making Scrambled Eggs
-Open your eyes and wake up in the morning
-Do downstairs and check in the fridge if they are eggs
	-If there are no eggs
		-Go to a neighbor to see if they have eggs
		-If neighbor's do not have eggs or do not answer, go to the grocery store to gets eggs
	-If there are eggs
		-Crack as many eggs as you deem fit.
		-Crack the eggs into a bowl
		-Pour a little bit of milk
		-Use a fork to swirl the eggs until it start to change color
		-Once it had changed color, pour the eggs into a pan with a hot counter top.
		-Swirl it around in the pan until it starts to solidify.
		-Once it starts to solidify, took it off the pan before the eggs start to turn brown.
		-Enjoy eating your eggs!
